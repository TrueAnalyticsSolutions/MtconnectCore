This is an open source implementation of [True Analytics Manufacturing Solution](https://github.com/TrueAnalyticsSolutions)'s MTConnect library using .NET Core.

This library is meant to mirror the MTConnect specification and provides easy methods and classes to implement MTConnect as close to the standard as possible.


### Documentation
Visit [mtconnectcore.dev](https://mtconnectcore.dev/getting-started/introduction) for the latest documentation.
The documentation itself is built from the same solution, so whichever branch you're referencing should contain the latest documentation for that code base.

### Installation
The core functionality between your own project and a MTConnect Agent can be done by referencing this (MtconnectCore) package.

```
> dotnet add package MtconnectCore
```

Or, in VisualStudio, open the *Manage NuGet Packages...* dialog and Browse for **MtconnectCore**.

## Publishing NuGet packages

The NuGet package is published using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TrueAnalyticsSolutions/MtconnectCore/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml).

## Contributors

True Analytics Manufacturing Solutions believes that MTConnect is a great solution for understanding manufacturing in realtime. For this, we've taken our proprietary code and made it open source.
Remembering our first attempts at getting started with MTConnect, we recognize that this library can help jump start others to make some great tools for manufacturing.

Feel free to create a branch and submit a PR. We highly recommend that you create an issue before you create a new branch so that everyone can be aware of what's being worked on.
